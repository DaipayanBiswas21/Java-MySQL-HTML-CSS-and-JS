<h3>About Me - Daipayan Biswas</h3><hr>
        <pre>I'm Daipayan Biswas, a passionate and self-driven engineering student from West Bengal, India, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, expected to graduate in 2026.
I've always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems — whether it's improving lives through healthcare innovations, safeguarding people during natural disasters, or protecting our planet through smart environmental monitoring systems.
My journey in technology began with a love for problem-solving, which led me to explore Java, Python, and SQL. 
I'm particularly interested in object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, and building impactful applications that blend software logic with real-world scenarios.
One of my proudest projects is the Planet Earth Monitoring System — a Java + SQL-based simulation that evaluates environmental parameters like Air Quality Index (AQI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) using advanced mathematical models. 
Beyond academics and coding, I'm someone who believes in continuous learning, be it understanding the physics behind renewable Energy.
I'm also working on becoming more street-smart, sharpening my soft skills, and staying updated with new technologies.
I aspire to use my technical knowledge to develop efficient, scalable, and meaningful solutions that can make a real difference — especially in the fields of healthcare, disaster management, and sustainable technology.
